# 🖥️ My Terminal Blog

A personal blog and portfolio built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, designed to mimic the look and feel of my terminal environment.

This project blends minimal design with developer-centric interaction patterns, and will gradually evolve into a fully keyboard-driven experience inspired by Vim and tmux.

It's design is currently a WIP as blending a terminal environment with proper UX methodologies proves to be quite a challenge!

## ✨ Overview

This site serves as:

* 📚 A daily study log
* ✍️ A space for long-form technical articles (made by me!)
* 🛠️ Contains my portfolio
* 🖥️ A terminal-inspired interactive experience

The UI is intentionally minimal and terminal-themed, reflecting the tools and workflows I use daily. Additionally the project was built with VIM with no plugins which might explain some weird formatting in certain areas :D.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

## 🎯 Planned features include
