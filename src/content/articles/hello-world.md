# Hello World 👋

Welcome to my blog! This is my very first post, so uuh hi :D.

## How It's Built

This blog is built with **Next.js**, serving content from local Markdown files. No database, no CMS — just `.md` files sitting in the repo. It keeps things simple, fast, and version-controlled with Git.

Down the road I'm planning to scale this out with a **NestJS** backend, but for now hosting content locally gets the job done and keeps the architecture clean.

## The Vision

This isn't just a blog. I want to build something that feels like a real terminal experience — think **vim keybindings**, **tmux-style pane navigation**, the whole thing. The aesthetic should feel native to anyone who lives in the terminal.

The goal is to keep it minimal but powerful — a place where I can share what I'm working on, what I'm learning, and whatever rabbit holes I fall into.

## What to Expect

I'll be posting updates on:
- Projects I'm actively building
- Tools and workflows I'm experimenting with
- Progress on the blog itself as features get added
- Im a huge productivity nerd so "productivitymaxxing" content

Stay tuned! there's a lot coming.
